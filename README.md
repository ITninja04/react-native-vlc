## New feature requests and bug fixes 

At the moment I am a bit tied up with other work. As a matter of fact, I don't get much time to develop at all nowadays. But I am more than open to help anyone who wants's to contribute to this repo. And I will be sure to merge any fixes as soon as PR's come up. But if you need someone to fix issues that affect you till I get back to this(ETA Q3 2022), One option is to add a bounty to the following site https://www.bountysource.com/ someone will attend to it.




## Supported RN Versions

Should work without any specific settings

## iOS

1. cd to ios
2. run `pod init` (if only Podfile has not been generated in ios folder)
3. add `pod 'MobileVLCKit', '3.3.10'` to pod file **(No need if you are running RN 0.61 and up)** 
4. run `pod install` (you have to delete the app on the simulator/device and run `react-native run-ios` again)

## Optional (only for ios)

in root project select Build Settings ---> find Bitcode and select Enable Bitcode

## TODO

1. Android video Aspect ratio and other params do not work (Events are called but all events come through a single event onVideoStateChange but the JS side does not implement it.).

## Use

```
import { VLCPlayer, VlCPlayerView } from 'react-native-vlc';
import Orientation from 'react-native-orientation';

    <VLCPlayer
        style={[styles.video]}
        videoAspectRatio="16:9"
        source={{ uri: "https://www.radiantmediaplayer.com/media/big-buck-bunny-360p.mp4"}}
    />

or you can use

    <VlCPlayerView
          autoplay={false}
          url="https://www.radiantmediaplayer.com/media/big-buck-bunny-360p.mp4"
          Orientation={Orientation}
          ggUrl=""
          showGG={true}
          showTitle={true}
          title="Big Buck Bunny"
          showBack={true}
          onLeftPress={()=>{}}
       />
```
